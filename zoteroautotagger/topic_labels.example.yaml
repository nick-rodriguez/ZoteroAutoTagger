# topic_labels.example.yaml

# This YAML file maps topic numbers (as generated by BERTopic) to
# human-readable, descriptive labels.
#
# It is used in `label_topics.py` to replace default topic names like "Topic 0"
# with more meaningful descriptions that are easier to interpret and search.
#
# Example use:
# If BERTopic assigns topic 3 to documents about immunotherapy,
# you can label it as: 3: "CAR-T and T Cell Immunotherapy"
